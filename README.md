# Distributed-File-System-with-Replication-locking-consistency-management
This project implements a Distributed File System (DFS) that ensures data replication, file locking, and consistency management across multiple file servers. The system allows clients to read, write, and manage files efficiently while maintaining synchronization between distributed nodes.
